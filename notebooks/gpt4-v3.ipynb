    "    system = \"You are an expert text classifier specializing in LLM training data. Your task is to classify each line of text based on its suitability for inclusion in a language model training dataset. High-quality content is clean, meaningful, well-structured, and useful for training language models. Low-quality content includes boilerplate elements (e.g., navigation menus, footers), non-linguistic symbols, formatting tags, placeholders like 'Lorem ipsum', and spammy, irrelevant, or toxic language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Line Identification and Separation**:\n",
    "   - Each line starts with \"Line X:\" where X is the line number. Treat each \"Line X:\" as a single unit, regardless of length; do not split lines.\n",
    "   - Lines are separated by newline characters (`\\n`) and dashes (`------`). If there's no newline character, treat the entire text as a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contextual Classification**:\n",
    "   - Use the context of all lines when classifying each one, as they are sequential and from the same document.\n",
    "   - For example, a line starting with a hyphen might be part of a list and should be classified as \"Clean.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assigning Labels**:\n",
    "   - Assign **exactly one label** to each line.\n",
    "   - If the line is suitable for inclusion, label it **\"Clean\"**.\n",
    "   - If not, assign a specific and descriptive label explaining why it's unsuitable.\n",
    "   - **Prefer labels from the provided list**. Only create a new label (max three words) if absolutely necessary.\n",
    "   - **Do not use vague labels** like \"Low-Quality,\" \"Bad,\" \"Unsuitable,\" etc. Labels must be specific and descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Focus on Linguistic Content**:\n",
    "   - Retain valuable and diverse linguistic content suitable for language model pre-training, including natural language patterns, standard advertising copy, commercial language, and promotional content written in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tolerance for Minor Errors and Toxic Language**:\n",
    "   - Minor grammatical errors, typos, or small mistakes do not disqualify a line from being \"Clean.\" Only exclude lines with pervasive errors that significantly hinder understanding.\n",
    "   - Mild expletives and controversial opinions do not disqualify a line from being \"Clean.\" Only exclude lines with blatantly hateful, harmful or toxic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output Format**:\n",
    "   - Your output must have exactly the same number of lines as the input, matching each line number correctly.\n",
    "   - Output only the line number followed by the label, separated by a colon.\n",
    "   - Do not include any additional text or explanations.\n",
    "   - Do not output dashes between the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines for \"Clean\" Lines**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign \"Clean\" to lines that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Represent natural language suitable for training language models.\n",
    "- Include informal internet language, grammatical errors, questions, partial sentences, and common online expressions.\n",
    "- Contain standard advertising or commercial language in natural sentences.\n",
    "- Have properly formatted titles, headings, and readable content, even with stylistic elements.\n",
    "- Include minor in-text elements like email addresses, dates, or URLs within natural sentences.\n",
    "- Are general promotional content written in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines for Non-\"Clean\" Lines**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines not classified as \"Clean\" need a specific and descriptive label. Examples include lines that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contain blatantly hateful or harmful language. \n",
    "- Are long passages of non-English text (excluding common foreign phrases used in English).\n",
    "- Include disclaimers, copyright notices, terms, and conditions.\n",
    "- Consist of menu items, login links, buttons, or navigation menus.\n",
    "- Contain random characters, garbled text, or excessive symbols.\n",
    "- Include programming code, HTML tags, or markup languages (when actual code or markup appears).\n",
    "- Present keywords, tags, or similar data without sufficient context.\n",
    "- Are irrelevant or spam-like content not suitable for training.\n",
    "- Are **excessively** promotional without natural language structure (e.g., a list of product names and prices without sentences).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Labels for Non-\"Clean\" Lines**:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Example Input:**\n",
    "\n",

      "Okay? Okay?? Please?\n",
      "Look, D, you had two months to say to Harvard in private emails, \"Im sorry, I shouldnt have been using that animation in my paid presentations. I wont use it again. I really do like 'Inner Life', though, and would love to use it in classroom presentations, from the BioVisions site, if that is acceptable.\"\n",
      "I sat here, for two months, waiting for that to happen, anything to happen, and it didnt. Two months, on your own terms, you could have written a similar post to yesterdays. I would have given you the benefit of the doubt-- maybe you didnt know the credits werent visible to the audience, and I wouldnt have said a word beyond this, as its Harvards problem, not mine. This would have been a funny joke to those of us involved in dealing with you people, but it would have been a PR non-issue for you.\n",
      "But after you set yourself on fire, you didnt douse it out with a bucket of ice cold reality and accountability. You ran. And youre still running.\n",
      "Why not just state \"I screwed up. Sorry everyone.\" and move on? Why the excuses? Why the denial? Why the passive language? Why the vague words and cryptic capitalizations? Why the writes and rewrites of your 'press release'? We know it wasnt written of your own volition, or it would have been done *before* Harvard had to take action. And, your behavior before this, regarding this issue, is not indicative of someone who made an innocent mistake. Its weird.\n",
      "So what with this frantic running? Is the inability to say \"I was wrong\" a pathological feature of Creationists? Or are you hiding something? Or is it both? Or is it more?\n",

      "...to my knowledge, Discovery Institute has neither authorized nor received nor is making use of any presentation that used that animation. We have had nothing to do with creating or selling a DVD of that animation, nor do we have anything to do with placing that presentation on Google Video.I dont know what he is talking about with that last part, but the first part sounds similar to DIs claims post-Dover (\"WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH DOVER!\"). Maybe Luskin is telling the truth. Maybe this was a magic non-science Creation-friendly narration with convenient edits that AiG or ICR would have killed for... but only Dembski could find it... but he cant tell us where... and he didnt share it with anyone... and its subsequently disappeared from the Internet...\n",
      "But that simply isnt what Ive been told. Maybe this was all a silly Dembski mistake, blown out of proportion due to his decision to remain silent... But what if we find more videos of more DI fellows, presenting this animation?\n",

This is Cleveland; let's just go out there and kick their Brown Stained a$$es all over Heinz field. End the season on a positive and hope that the GM and ownership make the necessary changes to make sure this underachieving season was simply a case of bad diarreah. Remember, if the Steelers go out and crap the sheets, this will stew in our bellies for upwards of 8 months. . .I'd rather end the season on a positive note.\n",

There's a pattern here. Every time the stock drops to a dollar/share or less, buyers like me come in. The stock gets pumped to around 1.30 or so, and we get out with a nice 25% gain. So' I've flip this stock 3 times now for $25k gains each time. It's a classic pump and dump stock. Don't EVER expect it to perform like a real company. It isn't. Yes, they make stuff; but only to make it lopk like a legitimate company. It's nothing more than a stock to play with. Buy now. Sell at 1.25. Have fun. I am.\n",

      "Meanwhile, we get closer to expanding our war on the Islamic terrorists that attacked us one year ago. Vice President Cheney has made it clear that the administration is preparing to liberate Iraq and take out Saddam Hussein. It's about time. In order to destroy terrorist networks like al Qaeda we need to overthrow the regimes that support them. As long as there are terrorist states like Iraq, Iran and Syria -- governments that harbor, train, and encourage terrorists -- we can never expect to completely succeed in our war against terror. The terrorists need to live somewhere -- we must do what is necessary to severely limit their housing options.\n",

      "Although Obama’s supporters continue to enjoy the largest tax increase ever dumped on the people by a sitting president, and while they prepare for the full takeover of the government by additional communists today in the Senate, perhaps they could take time off from reveling in the final destruction of this country long enough to explain why Obama has murdered Maulvi Nazir and 12 other people in Pakistan with a drone attack. Last time I checked, which was yesterday morning, not only was the United States not at war with Pakistan, but Pakistan had finally reached a truce with Maulvi Nazir, which had the promise of finally stabilizing portions of North Wazirstan with its attendant benefits of stabilizing the tribal regions in a way that might have also brought a political solution to Afghanistan. OK, Nazir was a no-goodnik and he didn’t like most Americans (who does?), but he was fast becoming a force of stability for one or our allegedly allied nations. Oh, and collateral damage of 12 people too, let’s not forget that.\n",
      "I know that the people on this blog who used to argue that Congress did not give W a blank check for the war in Afghanistan apparently intended to give a blank check to Obama, who was still working through the Peter Principle at the time (2001) to attack and kill criminal suspects in Pakistan. But did Congress really intend Obama to have the power to kill someone working with one or our allies, which happens not only to be experiencing growing frustration and anger with Americans, but which also possesses nuclear weapons and has deferred from nuclear proliferation partly out of goodies received from its American ally? And whatabout the credible argument that for every questionable militant killed by a drone Obama is creating 100 more recruits?\n",
      "I’d like those folk who support Obama to explain this foreign policy to me–where Obama has the power to continue killing people in Pakistan over the objections of the allied government, and why this policy makes any political, military, legal or ethical/moral sense. Then you can go back to enjoying Obama’s tax payer financed vacation.\n",

      "Especially in the UK, there were allegations of racism in football in both host countries. The main cause of discussion was the BBC current affairs programme Panorama, entitled Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate, which included recent footage of supporters chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners in Poland, plus Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine. The documentary was first echoed in much of the British press, but was then attacked for being one-sided and unethical: critics included other British media outlets; anti-racism campaigners, black and Jewish community leaders in Poland; Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists; England fans visiting the host nations and Gary Lineker.\n",

      "The understatements only serve to highlight and magnify the vulgarities of the \"devil\" scenes. The possessed Regan spins her head 180°, smacks her mother in the face, and masturbates with a crucifix, all while screaming phrases like \"Let Jesus f**k you\" and \"Your mother sucks c**ks in hell.\" I may have a strange sense of humor, but I find that sort of thing very funny coming from a pre-teen, even one in grotesque Dick Smith makeup. She even spews green pea soup. We usually only get that kind of action in splatstick comedies. Sadly, Friedkin and screenwriter Blatty (who also wrote the original novel) cannot see the humor in what they create, nor do they seek to create melodrama by giving the devil some purpose for his gibberish. The few times we see an unpossessed Regan, she is such a blank personality that it is impossible to be too concerned for her well-being. The result of all of the above is that Regan MacNeil, possessed girl, becomes nothing more than a cacophony of pseudo-horrific blather, blaring so loudly above the otherwise low-key soundtrack that she becomes incomprehensible.\n",

      "The above-described rental method preferably is carried out by a computer system such as that shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,029,034, issued Jul. 2, 1991, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,050,031, issued Sep. 17, 1991. Both of those patents are assigned to the assignee of the present patent application.\n",
      "Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide equipment and methods for merchandise distribution data processing which overcomes or substantially alleviates the foregoing problems.\n",
      "More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide equipment and methods for use in video record revenue-sharing which significantly reduce the cost of entry into the revenue-sharing plan.\n",
      "Another object of the invention is to provide a data collection system and method which can be used with a wide variety of computers and software without significant modifications.\n",
      "It also is an object of the invention to provide a relatively low-cost and compact point-of-sale input terminal.\n",
      "The foregoing objects are met by the provision of a data collection means and method, operating on signals used to display data in the local computers, to collect data for transmitting to a central computer. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the data is video record rental and sale data from retail distribution locations.\n",
      "If desired, the rental data is segregated from that relating to the sale of other merchandise, and the data for revenue-sharing rentals is identified so that it can be further segregated by the central computer. Alternatively, if desired, the revenue-sharing data can be segregated locally so that only it will be sent to the central computer. Optionally, the revenue-sharing data can include pay-per-play data developed by the use of play-counting cassettes.\n",
      "The invention is capable of segragating rental transaction data from sales transaction data. Additionally, revenue-sharing rental transaction data can be segregated from non-revenue sharing data. Further, if desired, sending of transaction data to the central computer can be controlled on a product or title ID basis.\n",
      "Selecting data from that used by display devices in the local point-of-sale (\"POS\") systems has the advantage that the data collection equipment used can be largely standardized and need not be customized to be compatible with each of the multitude of hardware and software systems now used as point-of-sale equipment. The data sent to the display device (display screen or printer, e.g.) almost always is in ASCII code. Therefore, a device responsive to that code will be useable with almost all such equipment.\n",
      "The invention includes a method for integrating into a data processing network, POS equipment which has incompatible software. A display data analyzing device is connected to the POS equipment to separate out and transmit to the central computer the data desired. Since the original POS equipment and software need not be changed, the cost of entry into the revenue-sharing plan is reduced significantly.\n",
      "Display data sent to the display screen and/or printer of the usual POS system is formatted by the system software so that predetermined data usually appears in a predetermined location on the screen and/or printed invoice, or receipt or other business form. In the present invention, advantage is taken of this fact to provide a relatively fast, inexpensive means for selecting data.\n",
      "The data is selected on the basis of its location on the display. Preferably, this is done by forming movable outlines of variable size on the display and capturing any data which falls within the outlines. In addition, recognition marks are placed on the display to identify that display as one which contains data to be captured; for example, data pertaining to the rental or sale of video records.\n",
      "Advantageously, the recognition marks and the location and size of the windows can be varied individually in each POS system, either locally by relatively simple manipulations of the POS system controls, or by a command downloaded from the central computer. Thus, each data collection device may be customized to accommodate the individual needs of the POS system. Moreover, this can be done by an ordinary installer who need not be a computer programmer.\n",
      "Changes made in the data collection system or POS system after installation similarly can be accommodated easily. For example, if the retailer decides to start renting play-counting tape cassettes such as those described in the above-identified patents, and therefore must capture data indicating the number of plays, the changes in the data capture procedures can be made relatively quickly and inexpensively.\n",
      "In accordance with the present invention, three novel devices called \"data taps\" 22 are used together with a LAN adapter card 21, a master PC 25 and software stored in the server 14, terminals T1 and T2 and in the master PC 25. Each data tap 22, as will be described in greater detail below, separates the information regarding video record rentals from the data which is sent to the printer or the display screen of the terminals T1 or T2 or the server 14, and sends the information to the master PC 25 which stores the information until it is transmitted through the modem 13 to the central computer 12.\n",
      "The three data taps 22 are connected together in series in a \"daisy chain\" sequence. There is one data tap for each terminal T1, T2, etc. and for the server 14 in the POS system.\n",
      "FIG. 3 is a partially perspective schematic view of an adapted POS system 60 which is the same as that used in Store No. 2 of FIG. 1, except that the terminal T2 and the server 14 are not shown, and only one data-tap 22 is used.\n",
      "The server 14 and each terminal T1, T2, etc. is a separate personal computer whose software is not compatible with that of the central computer. The LAN adapter card 21 and modem 13 shown in Store No. 2 of FIG. 1 are inside the master unit 25 and are not visible in FIG. 3.\n",
      "As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, each respective data tap 22 is connected to the terminals T1, T2 and the server 14, and is further coupled through the LAN adapter 21 to the master computer 25. One of the data taps, for example, the data tap connected to terminal T1 is also connected to the printer 16. The data tap 22 is adapted to receive and temporarily store all data displayed on the display screen of the terminals T1, T2, and data to be printed on the printer 16. The captured data is thereafter supplied through the LAN adapter to the master computer.\n",
      "A \"TSR\" program disc 52 is shown in FIG. 3. As it will be described in greater detail below, the TSR program is used in each terminal T1, T2, etc. to facilitate data selection and processing in accordance with the invention.\n",
